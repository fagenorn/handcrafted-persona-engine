## <a id="overview"></a>🌸 Overview: What's Inside?

Persona Engine listens to your voice 🎤, thinks using powerful AI language models 🧠 (guided by a personality you define!), speaks back with a synthesized voice 🔊 (which can optionally be cloned using RVC!), and animates a Live2D avatar 🎭 accordingly.

It integrates seamlessly into streaming software like OBS Studio using Spout for high-quality visual output. The included "Aria" model is specially rigged for optimal performance, but you can integrate your own Live2D models (see the [Live2D Integration Guide](./Live2D.md)).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Persona Engine achieves the most natural and in-character interactions when used with a **specially fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM)**. This model is trained to understand the engine's specific communication format.
>
> While you *can* use standard OpenAI-compatible models (e.g., from Ollama, Groq, OpenAI), it requires careful **prompt engineering** within the `personality.txt` file. We provide a template (`personality_example.txt`) in the repository to guide you.
>
> **Detailed instructions for configuring `personality.txt` for standard models are crucial and can be found in the [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md#configure-personality-txt---important).**

    * Loads and renders Live2D models (`.model3.json`).
    * Includes the specially rigged "Aria" model.
    * Supports emotion-driven animations (`[EMOTION:name]`) and VBridger-standard lip-sync parameters.
    * Dedicated services for **Emotion**, **Idle**, and **Blinking** animations.
    * **See the detailed [Live2D Integration & Rigging Guide](./Live2D.md) for custom model requirements!**

* 🧠 **AI-Driven Conversation:**
    * Connects to OpenAI-compatible Large Language Model (`LLM`) APIs (local or cloud).
    * Guided by your custom `personality.txt` file.
    * Features **improved conversation context** and **session management** for more robust interactions.
    * Optimized for the optional special fine-tuned model (see [Overview](#overview)).

* 🗣️ **Voice Interaction (Requires NVIDIA `GPU`):**
    * Listens via microphone (using `NAudio`/`PortAudio`).
    * Detects speech segments using Silero `VAD`.
    * Understands speech using Whisper `ASR` (via `Whisper.NET`).
    * Includes dedicated **Barge-In Detection** to handle user interruptions more gracefully.
    * Uses a small, fast Whisper model for interruption detection and a larger, more accurate model for transcription.

* 🔊 **Advanced Text-to-Speech (`TTS`) (Requires NVIDIA `GPU`):**
    * Sophisticated pipeline: Text Normalization -> Sentence Segmentation -> Phonemization -> `ONNX` Synthesis.
    * Brings text to life using custom `kokoro` voice models.
    * Uses `espeak-ng` as a fallback for unknown words/symbols.

* 👤 **Optional Real-time Voice Cloning (`RVC`) (Requires NVIDIA `GPU`):**
    * Integrates `RVC` `ONNX` models.
    * Modifies the `TTS` voice output in real-time to sound like a specific target voice.
    * Can be disabled for performance.

* 📜 **Customizable Subtitles:**
    * Displays spoken text with configurable styling options via the `UI`.

* 💬 **Control `UI` & Chat Viewer:**
    * Dedicated `UI` window for monitoring engine status.
    * Viewing latency metrics (LLM, TTS, Audio)
    * Live adjustment of `TTS` parameters (pitch, rate) and Roulette Wheel settings.
    * View and edit the conversation history.

* 👀 **Screen Awareness (Experimental):**
    * Optional Vision module allows the AI to "see" and read text from specified application windows.

* 🎡 **Interactive Roulette Wheel (Experimental):**
    * An optional, configurable on-screen roulette wheel for interactive fun.

* 📺 **Streaming Output (`Spout`):**
    * Sends visuals (Avatar, Subtitles, Roulette Wheel) directly to OBS Studio or other `Spout`-compatible software.
    * Uses separate, configurable `Spout` streams (no window capture needed!).

* 🎶 **Audio Output:**
    * Plays generated speech clearly via `PortAudio`.

* ⚙️ **Configuration:**
    * Primary setup via `appsettings.json` (details in [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md#configuration-appsettingsjson)).
    * Real-time adjustments for some settings via the Control `UI`.

* 🤬 **Profanity Filtering:**
    * Basic keyword list + optional Machine Learning (`ML`)-based filtering for `LLM` responses.

## <a id="architecture"></a>⚙️ Architecture / How it Works

Persona Engine operates in a continuous loop, bringing your character to life through these steps:

1.  **Listen:** 🎤
    * A microphone captures audio.
    * A Voice Activity Detector (VAD) identifies speech segments.

2.  **Understand:** 👂
    * A fast Whisper model detects potential user interruptions.
    * Once speech ends, a more accurate Whisper model transcribes the full utterance.

3.  **Contextualize (Optional):** 👀
    * If enabled, the Vision module captures text content from specified application windows.

4.  **Think:** 🧠
    * Transcribed text, conversation history, optional screen context, and rules from `personality.txt` are sent to the configured Large Language Model (LLM).

5.  **Respond:** 💬
    * The LLM generates a text response.
    * This response may include emotion tags (e.g., `[EMOTION:😊]`) or commands.

6.  **Filter (Optional):** 🤬
    * The response is checked against profanity filters.

7.  **Speak:** 🔊
    * The Text-to-Speech (TTS) system converts the filtered text into audio.
    * It uses a `kokoro` voice model primarily.
    * It falls back to `espeak-ng` for unknown elements.

8.  **Clone (Optional):** 👤
    * If Real-time Voice Cloning (RVC) is enabled, it modifies the TTS audio in real-time.
    * This uses an ONNX model to match the target voice profile.

9.  **Animate:** 🎭
    * Phonemes extracted during TTS drive lip-sync parameters (VBridger standard).
    * Emotion tags in the LLM response trigger corresponding Live2D expressions or motions.
    * Idle animations play when the character is not speaking to maintain a natural look.
    * **(See [Live2D Integration & Rigging Guide](./Live2D.md) for details!)**

10. **Display:**
    * 📜 Subtitles are generated from the spoken text.
    * 📺 The animated avatar, subtitles, and optional Roulette Wheel are sent via dedicated Spout streams to OBS or other software.
    * 🎶 The synthesized (and optionally cloned) audio is played through the selected output device.

11. **Loop:**
    * The engine returns to the listening state, ready for the next interaction.
